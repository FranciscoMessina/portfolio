# Francisco Messina - Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio, since design is not my favorite thing I took inspiration from the following videos: [Portfolio Javascript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPaLnMw2i_0&t=2003s)(The lovely SVG Animation came from this video) & [Portfolio DesignCourse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vp6GC3jKG20&list=PLviuEGE4wFJcSyYqY_yrSokdNmh9DnhJd&index=74&t=4481s)(The main theme and design from this video), but I enhanced it by adding a dedicated projects page, and project detail. On top of that , using Firebase I made it so new projects can be added with a form, and existing ones modified or deleted.
